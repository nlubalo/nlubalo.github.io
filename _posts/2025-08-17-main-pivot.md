<p>
I’m expanding my career from Senior Data Engineer to LLM / Generative AI Specialist.
This page documents my journey, broken into weekly milestones — each link goes deeper into my hands-on work, code, and reflections..
</p>

#### Phase 1: Core AI & LLM Foundations (Months 1–2)

- **Week 1 → [Data Loading, Tokenization & Embeddings Playground]**
  Built the foundation by preparing text datasets, applying tokenization, and setting up embeddings. Then trained word embeddings (Word2Vec-style) and visualized how words cluster semantically in vector space
- **Week 2 → [Attention Mechanism from Scratch]**
  Implemented scaled dot-product attention (Queries, Keys, Values). Visualized attention heatmaps.
- **Week 3 → [Multi-Head Attention & Mini Transformer Block]**
  Extended attention into multi-heads, added feed-forward networks and layer normalization.
- **Week 4 → [Mini-GPT: Character-Level Language Model]**
  Built a decoder-only Transformer, trained it on a small dataset, and generated Shakespeare-style text.

---

#### Phase 2: RAG & Applied LLMs (Months 3–4)

- **[Company Knowledge Bot with RAG]**
  Connected an LLM to external documents using embeddings + vector search (FAISS/Pinecone).
- **[Semantic Search Demo]**
  Built semantic search over custom text collections.

---

#### Phase 3: Agents & Tool Use (Months 5–6)

- **[Multi-Agent Research Assistant]**
  Built LLM agents that plan, retrieve, and summarize collaboratively.

---

#### Phase 4: Fine-Tuning & Deployment (Months 7–10)

- **[Fine-Tuned Domain LLM]**
  Customized a small open-source model for domain-specific tasks (classification + Q&A).
- **[Deployed RAG Chatbot]**
  Packaged a chatbot with FastAPI + Docker, deployed to the cloud.

---

#### Phase 5: Branding & Consulting (Months 11–12)

- **[Portfolio Wrap-Up]**
  Compiled projects into case studies, documented consulting-ready AI solutions, and published learnings.
